        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Peter Geertsema. I'm a rising Sophomore at the University of Maryland - College 
          Park where I study Computer Science and Economics. Go Terps!</p>

        <h2>A few facts about me</h2>
        <p>I've lived in Maryland my whole life, and as such love the MD flag, blue crabs, 
          and of course -- old bay!</p>
        <p>Some of my absolute favorite things to do in my free time include spending time in the 
          great outdoors. I love hiking, biking, kayaking, and especially backpacking.</p>
        <p>Favorite sports team? I disowned the Redskins a long time ago, so I'll 
          have to go with the Nats!</p>
        <p>Favorite sitcom? Glad you asked! How does the show about nothing sound? I know, I know. 
          Why would an 18-year-old like myself enjoy the same show as his parents? 
          It's just a beautifully written show. Favorite episodes? 
          The Fusilli Jerry, The Shower Head, The Marine Biologist.</p>
        <p>Favorite foods? Pizza, lasagna, sushi. This is a difficult to answer since there's not 
          much food I don't love!</p>
        <p>I could use a good haircut right now! The COVID quarantine has left me with a veritable 
          mane of hair that fails to respond to conventional warfare.</p>
        
        <p>My family has a pet bunny - named <a href="mickey.html">Mickey</a> - who we've 
          had since 2010. For those keeping track, he was fully grown when we got him, 
          so he's at least 11 now. Bunnies are only supposed to live around 8 years!</p>
