      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>My name is Peter Geertsema. I'm a rising Sophomore at the University of Maryland - College Park where I study Computer Science and Economics. Go Terps!</p>

      <h2>A few facts about me</h2>
      <p>I've lived in Maryland my whole life, and as such love the MD flag, blue crabs, and of course -- old bay!</p>
      <p>Some of my absolute favorite things to do in my free time include spending time in the great outdoors. I love hiking, biking,
             kayaking, and especially backpacking.</p>
      <p>Favorite sports team? I disowned the Redskins a long time ago, so I'll have to go with the Nats!</p>
      <p>Favorite sitcom? Glad you asked! How does the show about nothing sound? I know, I know. Why would an 18-year-old like myself
             enjoy the same show as his parents? It's just a beautifully written show. Favorite episodes? 
             The Fusilli Jerry, The Shower Head, The Marine Biologist.</p>
      <p>Favoite foods? Pizza, lasagna, sushi. This is a difficult to answer since there's not much food I don't love!</p>
      <p>I could use a good haircut right now! The COVID quarantine has left me with a veritable mane of hair that fails to respond to conventional warfare.</p>
      
      <p>My family has a pet bunny - named <a href="mickey.html">Mickey</a> - who we've had since 2010. For those keeping track, he was fully grown when we got him, so he's at least 11 now. 
            Bunnies are only supposed to live around 8!</p>
